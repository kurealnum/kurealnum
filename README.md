### Hi there 👋 I'm Oscar, I'm 16, and a HS sophomore. 

- I’m likely working on school, my personal projects, or algorithms
- I'm learning some forms of APIs, better design patterns, and Java
- I’d like to learn C++, Java, Docker, and maybe AWS?
- I’m always looking to collaborate on something, just contact me!
- I’m always looking for help with my personal project, NP Link. (NPL)
- You can reach me by my personal email: oscar.gaske.cs@gmail.com, or my discord: kureal#0464
